title: Quantifying probabilities from ballistic models
categories: codes
tags: gbf probabilities post-processing grid
---

Here is presented an extended version of the Matlab post-processing function developed for the **[Great Balls of Fire]({{ site.baseurl }}/pages/gbf)** model for the probabilistic hazard assessment of ballistic impact. This function has been modified so output files of virtually any model can be loaded and processed through methods described <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/304243833_Great_Balls_of_Fire_A_probabilistic_approach_to_quantify_the_hazard_related_to_ballistics_-_A_case_study_at_La_Fossa_volcano_Vulcano_Island_Italy" target="_blank">here</a>. Requirements are:
1. Impact coordinates must be defined in UTM WGS84
2. Files must be ascii and tab delimited
3. Columns in the output file should be organised as indicated in the table below. Note that adding extra columns is acceptable

## 1. From ballistic modelling to probabilistic hazard assessment

### 1.1 The need of a reference area
Unlike for tephra deposits, the discrete nature of ballistic impacts requires to average single ballistic impacts on a grid. Grids can fall in two main categories that are **polar** and **cartesian**. However, averaging impacts on a grid creates a dependancy of the final result to the spatial resolution. In other words:
1. Is it acceptable for a grid to have pixels areas that vary with distance from the vent (e.g., polar grids)?
2. Since increasing the pixel area increases the probability of impact, is there a threshold of grid resolution that provides stable results?
3. How does the grid shape/resolution interacts with the number of simulated ballistics and affect the stability of results?

Probabilistic hazard assessment for ballistic impacts should therefore address these issues, one possible way to do so being through *sensitivity analysis*. This new post-processing function can be accessed either through a GUI or programatically, which facilitates sensitivity analyses. Refer to our <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/304243833_Great_Balls_of_Fire_A_probabilistic_approach_to_quantify_the_hazard_related_to_ballistics_-_A_case_study_at_La_Fossa_volcano_Vulcano_Island_Italy" target="_blank">JVGR</a> paper for more information.

	<figcaption><b>Fig. 1</b> Illustration of the different approaches to average ballistics including i) polar grids with constant concentric distance from the vent, ii) polar grids with increasing distance from the vent, iii) cartesian grids and iv) area of interests</figcaption>
</figure>

In this post-processing function, a true polar grid is not implemented. Instead, probabilities of impact are calculated using both **a given distance from the vent** (i.e., concentric rings) and at **a given radial sector around the vent**. The union probability of both approaches will result in a polar grid.

### 1.2 What probabilities?
In frequentist analyses, probabilities must represent a ratio between a *number of ballistic impacts* satisfying a given characteristics (e.g., a kinetic energy at impact that exceeds a threshold) and a *total number of ballistics*. Depending on our definition of the second term, let's call it **B<sub>TOT</sub>**, probabilities are going to express a different message.

If **B<sub>TOT</sub>** is the total number of simulated ballistics, the probability expresses **P(Z, E<sub>T</sub>)**, that is:
<div class="message">
  What is the probability of a zone Z to be impacted by a ballistic impact with an energy threshold greater than E<sub>T</sub>?
</div>

If **B<sub>TOT</sub>** is the total number of ballistics impacting a given zone, the probability expresses **P(E<sub>T</sub>|Z)**, that is:
<div class="message">
	What is the probability of a ballistic impacting zone Z to exceed an impact energy greater than E<sub>T</sub>?
</div>

These probabilities are significantly different, and both are considered in the post-processing approach presented here. For simplicity, we will refer to **B<sub>TOT</sub>** as **absolute probabilities** and **B<sub>TOT</sub>** as **relative probabilities**.

## 2 Using the function
### 2.1 Input arguments
Table 2 summarises the input parameters required by the **processGBF** function. Functions can be called using a **GUI**, **arguments** or a **structure**. The following steps assume that you are in the root of the folder containing the functions.

</div>


#### 2.1.1 Using the GUI

In the Matlab command, type:
{% highlight matlab %}
processGBF
{% endhighlight %}

This approach will open two consecutive GUIs that will prompt you to i) locate the input file and ii) define the additional variables described above.

#### 2.1.2 Using arguments
This approach allows the user to enter all input argument separately from the command line:
{% highlight matlab %}
processGBF(pth, name, gridRes, subset, eT, pT, dI, rI, vE, vN, vZ)
{% endhighlight %}

All variables refer to Table 1.

#### 2.1.3 Using an input structure
The structure approach combines the arguments 2-9 of the argument approach into a structure. It is useful to use to output of a GBF post-processing run.

{% highlight matlab %}
processGBF(pth, run)
{% endhighlight %}

where **run** is a Matlab structure named as the arguments 2-9 of the argument approach.

### 2.2 Output argument
Calling:
{% highlight matlab %}
project = processGBF(...)
{% endhighlight %}

returns a Matlab structure containing all the output data... but stick around until the next section!


## 3 Outputs and results
Upon completion of the **processGBF** function, a folder named after the **name** variable is created, which contains results in a Matlab format (i.e., *name*.mat) and in a ESRI ASCII grid format. All probabilities are expressed in % and all energies are expressed in Joules.

### 3.1 ASCII grid format
Three main categories of ASCII files are written:
1. **pixel**, which use a cartesian grid
2. **concentric**, which use concentric zones around the vent
3. **radial**, which use radial sectors around the vent

Each of these categories have sub-categories defined by:
1. **prob**, which contain the exceedence probabilities (%) for ballistic impacts to exceed a given threshold of kinetic energy
2. **en**, which contain the typical kinetic energy (J) at impact for a given exceedance probabillity

The probability files are themselves differentiated between:
1. **abs**, which contain absolute probabilities and
1. **rel**, which contain relative probabilities



### 3.2 Matlab format
The Matlab output file, i.e. *name*.mat, contains the most comprehensive output. It is compiled as a Matlab *structure* containing:
1. **inBal**, which is a duplicate of the input arguments shown in Table 1
2. **bal**, which contains the data of all simulated particles
3. **pixel**, which contains the result of the processing performed using a cartesian grid  
4. **concentric**, which contains the result of the processing performed  using concentric zones around the vent
5. **radial**, which contains the result of the processing performed using radial sectors around the vent
