Here are listed some of the codes I am working on.

### TephraProb
**[TephraProb]({{ site.baseurl }}/pages/tephraprob)** is a Matlab toolbox for the probabilistic hazard assessment of tephra fallout.

### TephraFits
**[TephraFits]({{ site.baseurl }}/pages/tephrafits)** is a Matlab function to describe the geometry of tephra deposits.

### TError
**[TError]({{ site.baseurl }}/pages/terror)** is a set of Matlab functions that use a Monte-Carlo approach to quantify the uncertainty of eruption source parameters calculated from tephra deposits.


### Great Balls of Fire
**[Great Balls of Fire]({{ site.baseurl }}/pages/gbf)** is a method for the probabilistic hazard assessment of ballistic blocks. It contain a simulator written in Scala and Matlab functions for the post processing.


### TOTGS
**[TOTGS]({{ site.baseurl }}/pages/totgs)** is a Matlab wrapper for the reconstruction of the total grain-size distribution of tephra fallout using the method of Bonadonna and Houghton (2005).


### CareySparks86
**[CareySparks86]({{ site.baseurl }}/pages/cs86)** is a Matlab implementation of the method of Carey and Sparks (1986) for estimating the height of Plinian plumes based on isopleth maps.
